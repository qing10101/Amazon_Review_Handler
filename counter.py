# ==============================================================================
#                      FAST ENTRY COUNTER SCRIPT
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script is designed for one purpose: to efficiently count the number of
# valid entries in a large JSON Lines file (one JSON object per line).
#
# WHY THIS APPROACH?
# ------------------
# Instead of reading the entire file into memory with methods like
# `file.readlines()`, which would crash on very large files, this script
# streams the file. It reads one line at a time, increments a counter, and
# then discards the line, using a minimal amount of memory.
#
# It also correctly ignores any blank lines in the file.
#
# No external libraries are needed.
#
# ==============================================================================

import sys  # Used for exiting the script gracefully on error
